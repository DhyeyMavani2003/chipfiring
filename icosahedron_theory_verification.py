Icosahedron Theory Verification Script

This script demonstrates the implementation of theoretical concepts from 
"Chip-firing on the Platonic solids" by Beougher et al., specifically
the icosahedron section theoretical results.

It verifies:
1. Independence number calculations and upper bounds for gonality (α(I) = 3)
2. Scramble theory and 2-uniform scramble implementation (||S|| = 8)
3. Screewidth bounds and relationship to scramble number (scw(I) ≤ 8)
4. Dhar's burning algorithm proof showing gonality = 9
5. Lemma 3 implementation for subgraph outdegree bounds
6. Complete theoretical verification showing icosahedron gonality is exactly 9
7. Demonstration that scramble number alone cannot determine gonality
