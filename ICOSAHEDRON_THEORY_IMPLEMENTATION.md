# Icosahedron Theory Implementation

## Overview

This document details the complete implementation of theoretical concepts from the icosahedron section of "Chip-firing on the Platonic solids" by Beougher et al. Our implementation provides computational verification of all major theoretical results and demonstrates that the icosahedron has gonality exactly 9.

## Mathematical Background

The icosahedron is a regular polyhedron with:
- **Vertices**: 12 
- **Edges**: 30
- **Faces**: 20
- **Vertex degree**: 5 (regular graph)

### 7. Egg-Cut Number
- **Function**: `icosahedron_egg_cut_number()`
- **Result**: Egg-cut number = 8
- **Relationship**: Equals scramble norm for icosahedron
